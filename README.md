This project utilizes the pre-trained BERT model nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment for sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews of The Sage and Drifter bar in San Francisco. The scraped reviews are processed and analyzed to determine whether they express positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The results are saved in a pandas DataFrame for further exploration.
